find unique colors first for no multi-render of cubes
  could do this by using hashmap and then going through
  and counting unique

randomly sample image to get max amount of colors

add outline shader to better see dark colors on background

if going instanced route need to find how to get the global
position into the shader


change shader to flat shading, don't worry about lighting
maybe add an outline for a borderlands style shader
  
show the picture in the top left

label and draw the axes/bounds

add drag and drop feature for image loading
