find unique colors first for no multi-render of cubes
  could do this by using hashmap and then going through
  and counting unique

add outline shader to better see dark colors on background

drag and drop on desktop and file selection on mobile

maybe add if def for web build to add in time null randomness
web doesnt like it

drag to spin controls, zoom in with mouse wheel

make them glow

add jpg support

better message box on fail, raygui good option here
also need some way to select file on mobile
