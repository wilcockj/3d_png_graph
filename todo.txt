find unique colors first for no multi-render of cubes
  could do this by using hashmap and then going through
  and counting unique

TODO: shader is not working correctly seems to change color based on distance from camera not absolute position,
which is why the camera rotating changes the color

change shader to flat shading, don't worry about lighting
maybe add an outline for a borderlands style shader
