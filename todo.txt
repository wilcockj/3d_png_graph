find unique colors first for no multi-render of cubes
  could do this by using hashmap and then going through
  and counting unique

add outline shader to better see dark colors on background

show the picture in the top left

label and draw the axes/bounds

add drag and drop feature for image loading

add web build to share easily and figure out file loading for that,
drag and drop on desktop and file selection on mobile

may need to change shader for web build?

maybe add if def for web build to add in time null randomness
web doesnt like it

may be easiest to just use GLSL 100 

drag and drop multiple images for other quadrants

drag to spin controls, zoom in with mouse wheel

make them glow
